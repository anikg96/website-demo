                    Our approach starts with the systematic discovery and validation of novel, antifibrotic targets by leveraging some of the worldâ€™s largest human multi-modal, single-cell datasets in the field of fibrotic diseases.

                Our aim is to develop anti-fibrotic drug candidates up to the clinical proof of concept. We have identified several novel anti-fibrotic targets of high biological relevance and will swiftly move to drug candidate development.

                        Our approach starts with the discovery and validation of novel, antifibrotic targets by leveraging one of the worldâ€™s largest human single-cell, multi-modal datasets in the field of fibrotic diseases.

                        Our aim is to develop anti-fibrotic drug candidates up to the clinical proof of concept. We have already identified several novel anti-fibrotic targets of high biological relevance and will swiftly move to drug candidate development.
